  abstract = {Thanks to recent advances, modern proof assistants now enable verification of realistic sequential programs. However, regarding the concurrency paradigm, previous work essentially focused on formalization of abstract systems, such as pure concurrent calculi, which are too minimal to be realistic. In this paper, we propose a library that enables verification of realistic concurrent programs in the Coq proof assistant. Our approach is based on an extension of the {$\pi$}-calculus whose encoding enables such programs to be modeled conveniently. This encoding is coupled with a specification language akin to spatial logics, including in particular a notion of fairness, which is important to write satisfactory specifications for realistic concurrent programs. In order to facilitate formal proof, we propose a collection of lemmas that can be reused in the context of different verifications. Among these lemmas, the most effective for simplifying the proof task take advantage of confluence properties. In order to evaluate feasibility of verification of concurrent programs using this library, we perform verification for a non-trivial application.},

  abstract = {The {$\pi$}-calculus, viewed as a core concurrent programming language, has been used as the target of much research on type systems for concurrency. In this paper we propose a new type system for deadlockfree session-typed {$\pi$}-calculus processes, by integrating two separate lines of work. The first is the propositions-as-types approach by Caires and Pfenning, which provides a linear logic foundation for session types and guarantees deadlock-freedom by forbidding cyclic process connections. The second is Kobayashi's approach in which types are annotated with priorities so that the type system can check whether or not processes contain genuine cyclic dependencies between communication operations. We combine these two techniques for the first time, and define a new and more expressive variant of classical linear logic with a proof assignment that gives a session type system with Kobayashi-style priorities. This can be seen in three ways: (i) as a new linear logic in which cyclic structures can be derived and a Cycle-elimination theorem generalises Cut-elimination; (ii) as a logically-based session type system, which is more expressive than Caires and Pfenning's; (iii) as a logical foundation for Kobayashi's system, bringing it into the sphere of the propositionsas-types paradigm.},

It extends Backhouse's `Do-It-Yourself Type Theory' to include inductive definitions of families of sets and definitions of functions by recursion on the way elements of such sets are generated. The formulation is in natural deduction and is intended to be a natural generalisation to type theory of Martin-L{\"o}f's theory of iterated inductive definitions in predicate logic.
Formal criteria are given for correct formation and introduction rules of a new set former capturing definition by strictly positive, iterated, generalised induction. Moreover, there is an inversion principle for deriving elimination and equality rules from the formation and introduction rules. Finally, there is an alternative schematic presentation of definition by recursion.
The resulting theory is a flexible and powerful language for programming and constructive mathematics. We hint at the wealth of possible applications by showing several basic examples: predicate logic, generalised induction, and a formalisation of the untyped lambda calculus.},

In such frameworks, object-level binding is encoded directly using meta-level binding. Although these systems seem superficially the same, they differ in a variety of ways; for example, in how they handle a context of assumptions and in what theorems about a given formal system can be expressed and proven. In this paper, we present several case studies which highlight a variety of different aspects of reasoning using HOAS, with the intention of providing a basis for comparison of different systems. We then carry out such a comparison among three systems: Twelf, Beluga, and Hybrid. We also develop a general set of criteria for comparing such systems. We hope that others will implement these challenge problems, apply these criteria, and further our understanding of the trade-offs involved in choosing one system over another for this kind of reasoning.},

Name reference structure induced by the simple hierarchy of types is studied, which fully characterises the typable terms in the set of untyped terms.

The constructs, which are easily translatable into the summation-less asynchronous {$\pi$}-calculus, allow programmers to organise programs as a combination of multiple flows of (possibly unbounded) reciprocal interactions in a simple and elegant way, subsuming the preceding communication primitives such as method invocation and rendez-vous. The resulting syntactic structure is exploited by a type discipline `a la ML, which offers a high-level type abstraction of interactive behaviours of programs as well as guaranteeing the compatibility of interaction patterns between processes in a well-typed program. After presenting the formal semantics, the use of language constructs is illustrated through examples, and the basic syntactic results of the type discipline are established. Implementation concerns are also addressed.},

  abstract = {We present a large and we think also significant case study in computer assisted formal reasoning. We start by giving a higher-order abstract syntax encoding of {$\pi$}-calculus in the higher-order inductive/coinductive-type theories CIC and CC(Co)Ind. This encoding gives rise to a full-fledged proof editor/proof assistant for the {$\pi$}-calculus, once we embed it in Coq, an interactive proof-development environment for CC(Co)Ind. Using this computerized assistant we prove formally a substantial chapter of the theory of strong late bisimilarity, which amounts essentially to Section 2 of A calculus of mobile processes by Milner, Parrow, and Walker. This task is greatly simplified by the use of higher-order syntax. In fact, not only we can delegate conveniently to the metalanguage {$\alpha$}-conversion and substitution, but, introducing a suitable axiomatization of the theory of contexts, we can accommodate also the machinery for generating new names. The axiomatization we introduce is quite general and should be easily portable to other formalizations based on higher-order syntax. The use of coinductive types and corresponding tactics allows to give alternative, and possibly more natural, proofs of many properties of strong late bisimilarity, w.r.t. those originally given by Milner, Parrow, and Walker.},

However, such generality has a cost: encoding higher-level features like functional computation in pi-calculus throws away potentially useful information. We show how a linear type system can be used to recover important static information about a process's behaviour. In particular, we can guarantee that two processes communicating over a linear channel cannot interfere with other communicating processes. This enables more aggressive optimisation of communications over linear channels and allows useful refinements to the usual notions of process equivalence for pi-calculus. After},

The previous type systems for deadlock- freedom either lacked a reasonable type inference algorithm or were not strong enough to ensure deadlock-freedom of processes using recursion. Although the extension is fairly simple, the new type system admits type inference and is much more expressive than the previous type systems that admit type inference. In fact, we show that the simply-typed {$\lambda$}- calculus with recursion can be encoded into the deadlock-free fragment of our typed {$\pi$}-calculus. To enable analysis of realistic programs, we also present an extension of the type system to handle recursive data structures like lists.

  abstract = {Work to date on combining linear types and dependent types has deliberately and successfully avoided doing so. Entirely fit for their own purposes, such systems wisely insist that types depend only on the replicable sublanguage, thus sidestepping the issue of counting uses of limited-use data either within types or in ways which are only really needed to shut the typechecker up. As a result, the linear implication (`lollipop') stubbornly remains a non-dependent \$\$S \textbackslash{}backslashmultimap T\$\$S{$\multimap$}T. This paper defines and establishes the basic metatheory of a type theory supporting a `dependent lollipop' \$\$(x\textbackslash{}backslash!:\textbackslash{}backslash!S)\textbackslash{}backslashmultimap T[x]\$\$(x:S){$\multimap$}T[x], where what the input used to be is in some way commemorated by the type of the output. For example, we might convert list to length-indexed vectors in place by a function with type \$\$(l\textbackslash{}backslash!:\textbackslash{}backslash!\textbackslash{}backslashmathsf \{List\}\textbackslash{}backslash,X)\textbackslash{}backslashmultimap \textbackslash{}backslashmathsf \{Vector\}\textbackslash{}backslash,X\textbackslash{}backslash,(\textbackslash{}backslashmathsf \{length\}\textbackslash{}backslash,l)\$\$(l:ListX){$\multimap$}VectorX(lengthl). Usage is tracked with resource annotations belonging to an arbitrary rig, or `riNg without Negation'. The key insight is to use the rig's zero to mark information in contexts which is present for purposes of contemplation rather than consumption, like a meal we remember fondly but cannot eat twice. We need no runtime copies of l to form the above vector type. We can have plenty of nothing with no additional runtime resource, and nothing is plenty for the construction of dependent types.},

Session types for the HO{$\pi$}-calculus capture high-level structures of communication protocols and code mobility as type abstraction, and can be used to statically check the safe and consistent process composition in communication-centric distributed software. Integration of arbitrary higher-order code mobility and sessions leads to technical difficulties in type soundness, because linear usage of session channels and completion of sessions are required in executed code. By using techniques from the linear {$\lambda$}-calculus, we develop a coherent and tractable session typing system for the HO{$\pi$}-calculus. We also present an alternative system based on fine-grained process types. The formal comparison between the two systems offers insight on the interplay between higher-order code mobility and session types. 1},

The science of mobile systems is as yet immature, however. This book presents the pi-calculus, a theory of mobile systems. The pi-calculus provides a conceptual framework for understanding mobility, and mathematical tools for expressing systems and reasoning about their behaviors.
The book serves both as a reference for the theory and as an extended demonstration of how to use pi-calculus to describe systems and analyze their properties. It covers the basic theory of pi-calculus, typed pi-calculi, higher-order processes, the relationship between pi-calculus and lambda-calculus, and applications of pi-calculus to object-oriented design and programming.
The book is written at the graduate level, assuming no prior acquaintance with the subject, and is intended for computer scientists interested in mobile systems.},

As this formulated MTLC can be readily embedded into ATS, a full-fledged language with a functional programming core that supports both dependent types (of DML-style) and linear types, we obtain a direct implementation of session types in ATS. In addition, we gain immediate support for a form of dependent session types based on this embedding into ATS. Compared to various existing formalizations of session types, we see the one given in this paper is unique in its closeness to concrete implementation. In particular, we report such an implementation ready for practical use that generates Erlang code from well-typed ATS source (making use of session types), thus taking great advantage of the infrastructural support for distributed computing in Erlang.},
